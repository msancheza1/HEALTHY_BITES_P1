## 📌 Project Overview

Healthy Bites provides a personalized nutrition experience based on:

- Weight and height
- Health conditions (e.g., diabetes, cholesterol)
- Dietary restrictions (vegetarian, gluten-free, lactose-free, allergies, etc.)

The system classifies the user’s physical condition and generates tailored recommendations, recipe suggestions, and weekly shopping lists.
